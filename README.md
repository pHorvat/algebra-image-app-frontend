# Alebra Image App Frontend

This is a React web application that allows users to view and upload images. It provides features such as user login/signup, image viewing, image upload to Azure Storage container, user profiles, hashtags and description for every uploaded photo, and search functionality.

## Disclaimer

This React web app is heavily based on the GitHub repository [yassinjouao/instagram-clone-frontend](https://github.com/yassinjouao/instagram-clone-frontend). I have made modifications and additions to adapt it to my specific use case, including integrating Azure Storage for image upload and storage. The overall structure and design inspiration are derived from the original repository. I would like to acknowledge and give credit to the original author for their work.
